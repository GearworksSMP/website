Yes, we encourage players to make content but there are some things to keep in mind.

 - Let other players know you will be recording or streaming ahead of time, especially if you will be including voices of other players
 - Don't break the server [rules](/rules) while making content.

> Can {insert mod} be added?

We try to keep the modpack lightweight and will most likely not add the mod but you are welcome to make your suggestion via [our Discord](https://discord.gg/NQJuhb6stv).

> Can I become a member without using Discord?

Yes, if you are a paid [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/uberswe) member please send a direct message there stating that you would like to join the server without joining Discord.

> How can I report someone breaking the rules?

The best way is to open a ticket on our [Discord](https://discord.gg/NQJuhb6stv). If this is not possible you can contact a moderator in-game or send a direct message via [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/uberswe).

> Is there an age requirement?

No, it's not possible to verify players age in a reasonable manner. We expect members to show maturity and will ban players for excessively spamming chat, griefing or other behaviour that doesn't follow the [rules](/rules)
