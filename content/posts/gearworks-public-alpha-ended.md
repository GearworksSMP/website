The public Alpha for the Gearworks SMP lasted from Friday, August 2, 2024 8:00 PM to Sunday, August 4, 2024 10:00 PM CEST.

We had a peak player count of 15 during this short time period and learned a lot. There were some bugs and issues but overall the setup seemed pretty stable. The servers never went over 10% CPU usage which is a good sign!
