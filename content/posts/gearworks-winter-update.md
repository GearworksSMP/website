The Winter update is here and a few items have been added and a lot has changed as we strive to always improve the Gearworks server!

First I want to say a huge thank you to my moderators, Kieranstinkyfeet, RascallyRabbit, ViperSoup, Kuha, SeaUnicorn, BigSwedish and MegaTron_X, for all the support and help running Gearworks!

Second, thank you to all members for all your support. We are currently 1 away from reaching 50 members!

Now, let's take a look at what is new and what has changed in this Winter update!

Version updated to 1.1.1

## New Mods

The following mods have been added to the server

### Storage Drawers

Storage Drawers was something we had in season 1 and it is now available here as well. Storage Drawers added Fabric support in November and we now have it here! This will most likely be the replacement for Create: Storage as we start migrating away from that mod. More info about this will come in the future, we are not removing anything at this time.

### Traveler's Backpack [Fabric]

Another mod from Season 1 is making a return! Travelers Backpack brings lots of fun backpacks you can find out in the world. It also features several upgrades you can use to enhance the backpacks. This will also most likely be the replacement for Create: Storage backpacks as we start migrating away from that mod. More info about this will come in the future, we are not removing anything at this time.

### Better Archeology

We want to add some fun items to find and some fun places to explore on the mining server. We have therefore added Better Archeology! 

Next mining server wipe is scheduled for Dec 21st.

### Axiom

We have a commercial license for Axiom and it is now available to everyone to use on the Creative server. Please be careful and use the undo function if you do something wrong.

Axiom is not included in the default modpack but you can download the 1.20.1 version from here: https://axiom.moulberry.com/download

You can then put this .jar file in the mods folder of the modpack.

### Pehkui

Some of the new effects from the Trick or Treat Candy requires this to change the player size.
