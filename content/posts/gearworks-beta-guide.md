Anyone who participates in the beta for 30+ minutes and submits the [beta feedback form](https://tally.so/r/mVVA7a) will also have the exclusive ability to equip the Beta Hat as part of the Gearworks SMP, modpack and Gearworks Additions mod.

## Survival servers

![Gearworks Survival Beta](/images/gearworks-beta-survival.png)

There are 6 different survival server and 4 of the servers have been prepped with an infinite amount of supplies for you to test with during the Beta.

We encourage you to try many different mods, not just Create. There is also Farmers Delight, Fruitful Fun, Go fish! and more!

### South West

This server uses [Lithosphere](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/lithosphere) for terrain generation.

### North East

This server uses [Tectonic](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/tectonic) for terrain generation.

### Mining Server

No additional supplies are provided on this server. There is no `/spawn` command. To leave user `/server {server}`

This server resets every 4 days, anything left on this server will be wiped.

### Uberswe's Central Server

![A view of Uberswe's central server](/images/gearworks-central.png)

For Uberswe's future survival series, players will be able to visit in adventure mode.

Inventory does not sync on this server currently.

## Creative Server

![Gearworks Creative Server Plots](/images/gearworks-creative.png)

On the creative server there is a predefined set of plots available for you to claim. You may claim a plot or go further out to claim open areas but you must make claims in order to build.

Claiming every available plot or making claims in order to, for example, build walls around other players is considered griefing.

Buildings built on plots will have a chance to be included in the Gearworks Additions mod and as part of world gen for the Gearworks SMP. There are Nether and End themed plots, building structures for the Nether and End dimensions are more likely to be included. Some things to keep in mind:

- Use survival friendly blocks, avoid decorating with ancient debris for example
- You may suggest loot tables by placing relevant items in a chest
- Please place a sign with your username somewhere in the build
- Avoid using copycats, especially smaller copycats, as these have issues
- Glued areas do not get copied, use the old method of gluing from Create 0.3
- Keep it small

Uberswe will most likely do a live stream of the builds towards the end of the beta.

## Minigames

## Claims

On the creative and survival servers you are able to claim areas using the map. By default the map is opened using the `M` key but may differ for some players. Make a selection on the map and right click to manage claims.

Claims have grief protection from mobs.

### Creating a Party

You can either create a party and invite other players or become allies with other parties.

Use `/openpac-parties create` to create a new party.

Use `/openpac-parties join {party}` to join another party.

Use `/openpac-parties ally add {party}` to make another party an ally, they should add you as well.

Use `/openpac-parties member invite {player}` to invite another player to your party.

There are more options available but this should be enough to get you started.

### Permissions

Check your keybinds for the "Open Parties and Claims" menu. This will allow you to manage permissions for party members and allies.

## Missions

On each survival server you will get a set of missions accessed via `/missions` which will award the server currency used for shops.

## World Download

After the beta is over we will provide world downloads for the NW, SW, SE and NE survival servers and the creative server. This will be posted on the [Discord](https://discord.gg/NQJuhb6stv).
