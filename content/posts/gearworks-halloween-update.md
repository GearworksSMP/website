During Halloween we added a few more items to the Gearworks server! Several items have been added that combine to make Trick or Treat Candy, the idea behind this candy is to either give you a Trick or Treat when you eat it and the result is fairly random.

The candy and the drops to make it will remain easy to obtain until November 5th, after that date the drop chances for items will become lower while it is still possible to make the candy.

There are also a few cosmetic items that have been added, the ability to craft these will not change throughout the year.

## Donut Hat

The donut hat is inspired by a player named Herobrine who has been a member since season 1. Well known for his donut shop.

## Witch Outfit

The witch outfit is inspired by a player named Chelcooo who enjoyed gathering heads of other players during her spare time. The witch hat will require 3 player heads to craft.

## Mega Mask

The mask of the first moderator on my community server and the player who really got things going, MegaTron_X. 

## Jack-O-Lantern

This item was added for halloween and will drop from mobs during October and early November.

## Trick Or Treat Candy

The new Trick or Treat Candy can be crafted using a sequenced assembly recipe as shown in the image.

This candy will either give a trick or a treat and I look forward to players testing the candy to see how it works!

The items needed to craft the item can be found from the following mobs.

### Echoing Core

This item drops from the Warden and has a high chance to drop for every kill.

### Ender Fragment

As the name suggests, the Ender Fragment will drop from Endermen.

### Ectoplasm

Ectoplasm will drop from several different mobs which were not as useful before. I look forward to seeing someone make a Stray farm or perhaps even a Trader Llama farm if it's possible?

### Shadow Essence

Finally we have Shadow Essence which drop from a few more mobs which did not have much purpose other than being mobs that you need to kill. Now there is actually a reason to make a Zombie Villager Farm or perhaps even a Endermite Farm?

The Endermite is also the only mob that drops both Ectoplasm and Shadow Essence.
