Gearworks SMP is a paid server that you can join [by becoming a paid Patreon member of Uberswe](https://www.patreon.com/uberswe/membership).

This server is recommended for players who are 18+ but we do not have any age verification.

Why join the server? Gearworks main focus is building using the [Create mod](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/create) and building a community around that. A large focus also tends to be around trains and train lines.

Here is a list of a few things we think are important:

- Stability and high server uptime
- A nice and welcoming community, we do not tolerate sexism, harassment, racism, etc.
- One flat fee, no microtransactions
- Regular tested updates
- Frequent events where every member is welcome
