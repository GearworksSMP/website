Currently, Gearworks SMP is in the testing phase and the [beta is currently open](/posts/gearworks-beta-guide/). It is free to join by downloading the modpack [here](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/create-gearworks).

The server is planned to go live mid September as a [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/uberswe) server. Any of the paid Patreon tiers will be free to apply to join. You will need a Minecraft Java account and the latest version of the [modpack](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/create-gearworks) to join.

Make sure to join our Discord to be notified when the beta goes live: https://discord.gg/NQJuhb6stv.
