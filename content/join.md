Gearworks SMP is a paid server that you can join [by becoming a paid Patreon member of Uberswe](https://www.patreon.com/uberswe/membership).

Why join the server? Gearworks main focus is building using the [Create mod](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/create) and building a community around that. A large focus also tends to be around trains and train lines.

Here is a list of a few things we thing are important:

- Stability is a priority, this means a high server uptime, in-frequent modpack updates, admins who help reduce lag and worlds/seasons that are longer than 1 year.
- We take our [Rules](/rules/) seriously and will ban players who don't follow them.
- Uberswe also plays and makes content on the servers.
- A focus on building, PVP is only allowed when both parties agree to it.
- Claims to protect your builds and inventories.
- Custom integrations to encourage engagement between players.
- Scalabity by combining multiple servers into a single instance.
