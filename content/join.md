Currently Gearworks SMP is in the testing phase and has just finished the Alpha test. We are now preparing for a public beta test which will be free to join by downloading the modpack [here](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/create-gearworks).

The server is planned to go live mid September as a Patreon server. Any of the paid Patreon tiers will be free to apply to join. You will need a Minecraft Java account and the latest version of the [modpack](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/create-gearworks) to join.

Make sure to join Discord to be notified when the beta goes live: https://discord.gg/NQJuhb6stv.
